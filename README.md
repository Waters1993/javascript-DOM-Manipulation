[Experiment with the live version](https://waters1993.github.io/javascript-bankist/)

## Motivation & Acknowledgements
This project was created while completing "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann

## Work Vs. Template Code
HTML elements and CSS styling were provided as a template file for this project.<br>
I created the applications functionality with JavaScript.<br>
Additional work involved colouring the tranactions table and adding a modal window to display login options for experimentation. 

## JavaScript concepts and techniques used
- Callback functions<br>
- Manipulation of Objects, Maps, & Arrays (Looping & Destructuring)<br>
- Internationalization (Date & Currencies)<br>
- DOM Manipulation<br>
- Timers<br>
- String Manipulation<br>
